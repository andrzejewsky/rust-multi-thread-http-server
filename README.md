# An example of multi-thread http server

Http server created for learning purposes, following the main assumptions:

- Implements the ThreadPool that handles concurrent connections
- Written from scratch a basic implementation of HTTP protocol
- Use as much Rust language elements as possible
- Leave some notes in the code for the future cases
